# Introduction to 360 Tours & Narrative Maps

- Pre-workshop activities: 7 min 
- Introductory presentation: 10 min
- Hands-on activities: 80 min

## Benefits of 360 Tours
360-Tours, and 360-Videos viewed using headsets that take up the viewers' full field of view can make for a much more impactful experience for people than a similar experience using a smartphone or computer. One example of this is a UN-authored study of [emersive 360-videos](https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/23/un-launches-powerful-oculus-virtual-reality-film-following-syrian-refugee-girl/){:target="_blank"} of the life of a resident in a Syrian refugee camp which when shown to westerners, lead to much higher empathy than people who watched regular videos on their computers or phones.

Another benefit is the heightened spatial understanding and immersion that Virtual Reality and 360-Tours provide, even for viewers using smartphones and web browsers. AR is a great tool for providing point-of-need text, video, and/or photographic information to people using smartphone AR apps.

## Some Definitions

Let's start with some definitions so that we are all on the same page: 
- **Virtual Reality** or **VR** is a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using equipment like VR Goggles that cover their complete field of view. [More information about VR](https://guides.library.utoronto.ca/c.php?g=607624&p=4938314){:target="_blank"}.
- **360 Tours & 360 Video** can be viewed in VR headsets, but are more commonly viewed on smartphones and web browsers. 360-Tours are a series of 360-degree still photographs that the viewer navigates through at their own pace, and can have embedded photos, videos and text in them.
- **Augmented Reality** or **AR** is a technology that lets people superimpose digital content (images, sounds, text) over a real-world environment. This is most commonly done using smartphone applications (like Pokemon Go) or less commonly using specialized AR headset glasses (like Microsoft Hololens).
